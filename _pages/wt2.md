## Abstract / Introduction
During my second work term with **Computing & Communications Services (CCS)**, I gained even more valuable experience in IT support and infrastructure management. I started working this position in May, focusing on help desk, team assignments, and application support, and this semester - I primarily focused on taking and receiving most phone calls. 

This page highlights what I accomplished, what I learned, and how this experience contributed to my academic and professional development.

- Campus-wide networking and Wi-Fi infrastructure
- Email and collaboration tools
- Information security and identity management
- Enterprise systems for teaching, research, and administration
- IT support through the help desk and technical services

As I iterated earlier, my role primarily involved help desk support, where I assisted users with technical issues and assigned teams to aid with various systems CCS manages. Other teams are more specialized, such as Managed Desktops, who works with physical hardware for their clients. Some more include Networking, who manages the university's network infrastructure, and Information Security, who ensures the safety of the university's data and systems.

# Goals

## Learning Goal 1

</p> 

**Category:** PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Leadership

**Goal:** Keep the team motivated and churning production.

**Action Plan:**
- Set goals for our team to complete by EOD, such as a ticket count we want to reach by a certain time. 
- Enhance team productivity by offering rewards such as snacks and drinks if we reach our goals.
  

**Measure of Success:**
We can keep the number of tickets in our Queue consistently low/response times under 3 days (due to weekends).

### **Reflection:**
Throughout the semester, we were consistently able to keep our ticket queue low, often times reaching even 0 tickets in the queue by noon. This was achieved by setting goals between ourselves to complete a certain number of tickets by a certain time, and then rewarding ourselves with breakfast, coffee, and even pizza if we reached our goals.

**Category:** COMMUNICATING - Written Communication

**Goal:** Provide more clear and detailed instructions in email communications.

**Action Plan:**
I always catch myself writing pretty much the bare minimum in emails - just answering the question and hoping they don't have any follow ups. I plan to remedy this by: 
- Creating more detailed text templates to fill in the missing gaps in my emails.
- Provide more common information and websites the user can follow which should hopefully answer their follow-up questions.

**Measure of Success:**
Lower rate of replies to my general tickets - essentially a change in ratio showing my tickets being resolved in less replies.

### **Reflection:**
Throughout the semester, I created several detailed email templates for common issues that users would frequently ask about, including but not limited to a few WebAdvisor issues, Internet Setups (especially with our new Wi-Fi portal for unsupported devices), and some e-transfer issues that would get commonly reported to our queue. These quick and easy replies helped reduce the load on not only me but our team, allowing us to focus on more complex tickets while still providing great quality support to our users without much effort. Although anecdotal evidence, I did notice a significant reduction in follow-up emails from users after implementing these templates, indicating that the additional information provided was effective in addressing their concerns upfront - if there was a follow-up, it was usually just to thank me for the information provided!

## Learning Goal 3
**Category:** PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Teamwork

**Goal:** Complete the most tickets out of any agent over the last 2 work terms.

**Action Plan:**
Keep consistent, pacing myself over the hours and completing both the easy grab tickets, and more complex ones at the same time to be as productive as possible.

**Measure of Success:**
Run a report and the end of the term and check if I completed the most amount of tickets.  
### **Reflection:**
By the end of the term, I was able to complete a total of ~2000 tickets, which was the highest out of any agent throughout the 8 months I was there - especially considering I was taking calls whenever possible. I achieved this by keeping a steady pace throughout the semester, making sure to complete a few tickets between my phone calls, and focusing my efforts equally on both easy picking tickets and more complex tickets that other agents would be reluctant to take.

## Job Description
My role at CCS was Student IT Consultant, Some of my key responsibilities included:

- Responding to technical support tickets and assisting users with hardware, software, and account issues.
- Documenting and escalating technical problems to specialized teams and staff when required.
- Assisting with the deployment and maintenance of campus IT systems.
- Learning about security best practices and applying them when troubleshooting user issues.

**Skills Required:**
- Strong communication and interpersonal skills to interact with diverse users.
- Technical knowledge of operating systems, productivity software, and networking basics.
- Adaptability to quickly learn new tools and systems, even ones I don't like (like macOS devices).

Some of these skills I had already gained in coursework (e.g., networking and systems fundamentals), while others (such as enterprise-level troubleshooting and user communication) I learned on the job.

## Conclusions
My second work term at CCS has been an invaluable experience that has significantly contributed to my professional and personal growth; although I am glad it is over with and want to immediately get back to learning. I don't plan on pursuing a career in IT support in the future, and I am grateful for the hands-on experience and skills I have gained during this time.

If someone were to summarize my experience, I would want them to say:  
*“This work term further enhanced my IT support skills, strengthened my ability to communicate effectively with users, and reinforced my understanding of teamwork in a professional setting. ”*
