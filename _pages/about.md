## Abstract / Introduction
During my work term with **Computing & Communications Services (CCS)**, I gained valuable experience in IT support and infrastructure management. I started working this position in May, focusing on help desk, team assignments, and application support, and I am eager to continue my position until the end of my second work term.

My role at CCS was Student IT Consultant, Some of my key responsibilities included:

- Responding to technical support tickets and assisting users with hardware, software, and account issues.
- Documenting and escalating technical problems to specialized teams and staff when required.
- Assisting with the deployment and maintenance of campus IT systems.
- Learning about security best practices and applying them when troubleshooting user issues.

**Skills Required:**

If someone were to summarize my experience, I would want them to say:
